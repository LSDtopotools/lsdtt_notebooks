# Notebooks for various lsdtopotools packages

## Getting started

The easiset way to get started is to use our Docker container, which has everything pre-installed. 

If you don't have docker, or don't want it, the next best way to install things is through a conda environment. 

Both the docker approach and the conda appraoch are problematic for Windows: docker installation on windows is not so easy (and impossible without administrator privileges) and conda will work on windows but the lsdtopotools command line tools do not have a working windows version. We highly reccomend you use a linux emulation system if you are using Windows (Windows Linux Subsystem, for example).

## What is in this repository

The notebooks in this repository work with various components of lsdtopotools, so check the readme in each subdirectory. The subdirectories are named in a way that hopefully explains their contents.
