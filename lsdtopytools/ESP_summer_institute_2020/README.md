# What is in this folder

You can find in this folder the Notebook I have been using for the ESP Summer Institute scientific lecture about LSDTopoTools-lsdtopytools. The notebook utilises lsdtopytools to extract channel network and other topographic analysis on an example raster. I will also put some of my slides in this repository.

**This is Work In Progress but should contain enough instruction for installing and using the software in a conda environment. conda-forge package now available**
